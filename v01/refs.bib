abstract = {Greater similarity of paired obese participants in an online network increased access to and adoption of health behaviors. How does the composition of a population affect the adoption of health behaviors and innovations? Homophily—similarity of social contacts—can increase dyadic-level influence, but it can also force less healthy individuals to interact primarily with one another, thereby excluding them from interactions with healthier, more influential, early adopters. As a result, an important network-level effect of homophily is that the people who are most in need of a health innovation may be among the least likely to adopt it. Despite the importance of this thesis, confounding factors in observational data have made it difficult to test empirically. We report results from a controlled experimental study on the spread of a health innovation through fixed social networks in which the level of homophily was independently varied. We found that homophily significantly increased overall adoption of a new health behavior, especially among those most in need of it.}

Prior research on complex problem solving by collectives has found the counterintuitive result that inefficient networks, meaning networks that disseminate information relatively slowly, can perform better than efficient networks for problems that require extended exploration. In this paper, we report on a series of 256 Web-based experiments in which groups of 16 individuals collectively solved a complex problem and shared information through different communication networks. As expected, we found that collective exploration improved average success over independent exploration because good solutions could diffuse through the network. In contrast to prior work, however, we found that efficient networks outperformed inefficient networks, even in a problem space with qualitative properties thought to favor inefficient networks. We explain this result in terms of individual-level explore-exploit decisions, which we find were influenced by the network structure as well as by strategic considerations and the relative payoff between maxima. We conclude by discussing implications for real-world problem solving and possible extensions.},

In particular, networks have been extensively used in predicting the spread of infectious diseases where individuals, or populations of individuals, interact with a limited set of others—defining the network through which the disease can spread. Here for such disease models we consider three assumptions for capturing the network of movements between populations, and focus on two applied problems supported by detailed data from Great Britain: the commuter movement of workers between local areas (wards) and the permanent movement of cattle between farms. For such metapopulation networks, we show that the identity of individuals responsible for making network connections can have a significant impact on the infection dynamics, with clear implications for detailed public health and veterinary applications.}

abstract = {The rise of bots and their influence on social networks is a hot topic that has aroused the interest of many researchers. Despite the efforts to detect social bots, it is still difficult to distinguish them from legitimate users. Here, we propose a simple yet effective semi-supervised method that allows distinguishing between bots and legitimate users with high accuracy. The method learns a joint representation of social connections and interactions between users by leveraging graph-based representation learning. Then, on the proximity graph derived from user embeddings, a sample of bots is used as seeds for a label propagation algorithm. We demonstrate that when the label propagation is done according to pairwise account proximity, our method achieves F1 = 0.93, whereas other state-of-the-art techniques achieve F1 ≤ 0.87. By applying our method to a large dataset of retweets, we uncover the presence of different clusters of bots in the network of Twitter interactions. Interestingly, such clusters feature different degrees of integration with legitimate users. By analyzing the interactions produced by the different clusters of bots, our results suggest that a significant group of users was systematically exposed to content produced by bots and to interactions with bots, indicating the presence of a selective exposure phenomenon.},

    abstract = { The study of social dilemmas is the study of the tension between individual and collective rationality. In a social dilemma, individually reasonable behavior leads to a situation in which everyone is worse off. The first part of this review is a discussion of categories of social dilemmas and how they are modeled. The key two-person social dilemmas (Prisoner's Dilemma, Assurance, Chicken) and multiple-person social dilemmas (public goods dilemmas and commons dilemmas) are examined. The second part is an extended treatment of possible solutions for social dilemmas. These solutions are organized into three broad categories based on whether the solutions assume egoistic actors and whether the structure of the situation can be changed: Motivational solutions assume actors are not completely egoistic and so give some weight to the outcomes of their partners. Strategic solutions assume egoistic actors, and neither of these categories of solutions involve changing the fundamental structure of the situation. Solutions that do involve changing the rules of the game are considered in the section on structural solutions. I conclude the review with a discussion of current research and directions for future work. }

But how do we choose between different methods and how do we judge whether the chosen method is appropriate for our specific study? Like in any science, in statistics, experiments can be run to find out which methods should be used under which circumstances. The main objective of this paper is to demonstrate that simulation studies, that is, experiments investigating synthetic data with known properties, are an invaluable tool for addressing these questions. We aim to provide a first introduction to simulation studies for data analysts or, more generally, for researchers involved at different levels in the analyses of health data, who (1) may rely on simulation studies published in statistical literature to choose their statistical methods and who, thus, need to understand the criteria of assessing the validity and relevance of simulation results and their interpretation; and/or (2) need to understand the basic principles of designing statistical simulations in order to efficiently collaborate with more experienced colleagues or start learning to conduct their own simulations. We illustrate the implementation of a simulation study and the interpretation of its results through a simple example inspired by recent literature, which is completely reproducible using the R-script available from online supplemental file 1.},

ABSTRACT={Simulation models in many scientific fields can have non-unique solutions or unique solutions which can be difficult to find. Moreover, in evolving systems, unique final state solutions can be reached by multiple different trajectories. Neuroscience is no exception. Often, neural network models are subject to parameter fitting to obtain desirable output comparable to experimental data. Parameter fitting without sufficient constraints and a systematic exploration of the possible solution space can lead to conclusions valid only around local minima or around non-minima. To address this issue, we have developed an interactive tool for visualizing and steering parameters in neural network simulation models. In this work, we focus particularly on connectivity generation, since finding suitable connectivity configurations for neural network models constitutes a complex parameter search scenario. The development of the tool has been guided by several use cases—the tool allows researchers to steer the parameters of the connectivity generation during the simulation, thus quickly growing networks composed of multiple populations with a targeted mean activity. The flexibility of the software allows scientists to explore other connectivity and neuron variables apart from the ones presented as use cases. With this tool, we enable an interactive exploration of parameter spaces and a better understanding of neural network models and grapple with the crucial problem of non-unique network solutions and trajectories. In addition, we observe a reduction in turn around times for the assessment of these models, due to interactive visualization while the simulation is computed.}

abstract = {Computer simulations are invaluable tools for scientific discovery. However, accurate simulations are often slow to execute, which limits their applicability to extensive parameter exploration, large-scale data analysis, and uncertainty quantification. A promising route to accelerate simulations by building fast emulators with machine learning requires large training datasets, which can be prohibitively expensive to obtain with slow simulations. Here we present a method based on neural architecture search to build accurate emulators even with a limited number of training data. The method successfully emulates simulations in 10 scientific cases including astrophysics, climate science, biogeochemistry, high energy density physics, fusion energy, and seismology, using the same super-architecture, algorithm, and hyperparameters. Our approach also inherently provides emulator uncertainty estimation, adding further confidence in their use. We anticipate this work will accelerate research involving expensive simulations, allow more extensive parameters exploration, and enable new, previously unfeasible computational discovery.}

abstract = {A good framework for the quantification and decomposition of uncertainties in dynamic building performance simulation should: (i) simulate the principle deterministic processes influencing heat flows and the stochastic perturbations to them, (ii) quantify and decompose the total uncertainty into its respective sources, and the interactions between them, and (iii) achieve this in a computationally efficient manner. In this paper we introduce a new framework which, for the first time, does just that. We present the detailed development of this framework for emulating the mean and the variance in the response of a stochastic building performance simulator (EnergyPlus co-simulated with a multi agent stochastic simulator called No-MASS), for heating and cooling load predictions. We demonstrate and evaluate the effectiveness of these emulators, applied to a monozone office building. With a range of 25–50 kWh/m2, the epistemic uncertainty due to envelope parameters dominates over aleatory uncertainty relating to occupants' interactions, which ranges from 6–8 kWh/m2, for heating loads. The converse is observed for cooling loads, which vary by just 3 kWh/m2 for envelope parameters, compared with 8–22 kWh/m2 for their aleatory counterparts. This is due to the larger stimuli provoking occupants' interactions. Sensitivity indices corroborate this result, with wall insulation thickness (0.97) and occupants' behaviours (0.83) having the highest impacts on heating and cooling load predictions respectively. This new emulator framework (including training and subsequent deployment) achieves a factor of c.30 reduction in the total computational budget, whilst overwhelmingly maintaining predictions within a 95% confidence interval, and successfully decomposing prediction uncertainties.}

abstract = {To understand and predict large, complex, and chaotic systems, Earth scientists build simulators from physical laws. Simulators generalize better to new scenarios, require fewer tunable parameters, and are more interpretable than nonphysical deep learning, but procedures for obtaining their derivatives with respect to their inputs are often unavailable. These missing derivatives limit the application of many important tools for forecasting, model tuning, sensitivity analysis, or subgrid‐scale parametrization. Here, we propose to overcome this limitation with deep emulator networks that learn to calculate the missing derivatives. By training directly on simulation data without analyzing source code or equations, this approach supports simulators in any programming language on any hardware without specialized routines for each case. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we train emulators on complete or partial system states of the chaotic Lorenz‐96 simulator and evaluate the accuracy of their dynamics and derivatives as a function of integration time and training data set size. We further demonstrate that emulator‐derived derivatives enable accurate 4D‐Var data assimilation and closed‐loop training of parametrizations. These results provide a basis for further combining the parsimony and generality of physical models with the power and flexibility of machine learning.},

Fast emulators provide a solution to this efficiency demand, sacrificing unneeded accuracy for speed. There are many strategies for developing emulators but selecting one remains subjective. Herein we compare the performance of two kinds of emulators: mechanistic emulators that use knowledge of the simulator's equations, and purely data-driven emulators using matrix factorization. We borrow simulators from urban water management, because more stringent performance criteria on water utilities have made emulation a crucial tool within this field. Results suggest that naive data-driven emulation outperforms mechanistic emulation. We discuss scenarios in which mechanistic emulation seems favorable for extrapolation in time and dealing with sparse and unevenly sampled data. We also point to advances in Machine Learning that have not permeated yet into the environmental science community.}

Combining different simulation methods offer an opportunity to overcome these challenges and to capture important characteristics and behaviours of such systems. Despite the growing interest and popularity in this approach, guidance for designing and utilizing hybrid models, especially for those combining SD and ABM, is scanty.

This paper investigates the potential impacts of aggressive merging behaviors by human drivers on traffic performance in a mixed environment. For this, three vehicle types - AVs, HDVs, and Aggressive HDVs (AHDVs) - are modeled in an open-source microscopic traffic simulation model, SUMO. In the developed simulation, the AHDVs are modeled to emulate aggressive merging behaviors in front of AVs at a merge section of a freeway exit ramp. Several experiments are used to study the impact of such behavior. Results show travel time gains by AHDVs at the expense of AVs and HDVs.},

The modular bridge construction (MBC) technique is considered more advantageous in providing higher productivity, shorter schedules, and better quality. Current practices in managing MBC projects overlook dynamic behaviors among the relevant stakeholders and the interactions among various interacting systems, including manufacturing, logistics, and onsite assembly. To this end, this paper proposes a simulation-optimization framework to enhance MBC project planning. The simulation module comprises discrete event simulation and agent-based modeling to model the interconnected behaviors of the MBC systems. The optimization module aims to improve the key performance indicators (KPIs) of MBC projects, including project cost, schedule, and sustainability. The proposed framework is validated by introducing an MBC case of a cable-stayed bridge. The generated solutions by the optimization model show possible significant enhancements in the identified KPIs.},

In this paper, we develop an approach that uses this emulation approach within a Bayesian model calibration framework to calibrate an agent-based model of an epidemic. In addition, this approach is extended to handle the multivariate nature of the model output, which gives a time series of the count of infected individuals. The basic modeling approach is adapted from [D. Higdon et al., J. Amer. Statist. Assoc., 103 (2008), pp. 570--583], using a basis representation to capture the multivariate model output. The approach is motivated with an example taken from the 2015 Ebola challenge workshop which simulated an Ebola epidemic to evaluate methodology. }

abstract = {Behavioral game theory seeks to describe the way actual people (as compared to idealized, ``rational'' agents) act in strategic situations. Our own recent work has identified iterative models (such as quantal cognitive hierarchy) as the state of the art for predicting human play in unrepeated, simultaneous-move games [Wright and Leyton-Brown 2012]. Iterative models predict that agents reason iteratively about their opponents, building up from a specification of nonstrategic behavior called level-0. The modeler is in principle free to choose any description of level-0 behavior that makes sense for the given setting; however, in practice almost all existing work specifies this behavior as a uniform distribution over actions. In most games it is not plausible that even nonstrategic agents would choose an action uniformly at random, nor that other agents would expect them to do so. A more accurate model for level-0 behavior has the potential to dramatically improve predictions of human behavior, since a substantial fraction of agents may play level-0 strategies directly, and furthermore since iterative models ground all higher-level strategies in responses to the level-0 strategy. Our work considers ``meta-models'' of level-0 behavior: models of the way in which level-0 agents construct a probability distribution over actions, given an arbitrary game. We evaluated many such meta-models, each of which makes its prediction based only on general features that can be computed from any normal form game. We evaluated the effects of combining each new level-0 meta-model with various iterative models, and in many cases observed large improvements in the models' predictive accuracies. In the end, we recommend a meta-model that achieved excellent performance across the board: a linear weighting of features that requires the estimation of five weights.},

abstract = {Agent-Based Models are very useful for simulation of physical or social processes, such as the spreading of a pandemic in a city. Such models represent the behavior of individuals (agents) and their interactions, based on the geography and demography of the city, and the resulting spread of infections. However, they are computationally very expensive. This seriously limits the usage of such models for simulations, which often have to be run hundreds of times for policy planning and even model parameter estimation. An alternative is to develop an emulator, a surrogate model that can predict the Agent-Based Simulator's output based on its initial conditions and parameters. In this work, we propose a Deep Learning model, based on the Dilated Convolutional Neural Network, that can emulate such an Agent-Based Model with high accuracy. We show that use of this model instead of the original Agent-Based Model provides us major gains in the speed of simulations, allowing much quicker calibration to observations, and more extensive scenario analysis. The models we consider are spatially explicit, as the locations of the infected individuals are simulated instead of the gross counts. Our framework uses a divide-and-conquer approach that divides the city into several small overlapping blocks and carries out the emulation in them parallelly, after which these results are merged together. This ensures that the same emulator can work for a city of any size, and also provides significant improvement of time complexity of the emulator, compared to the original simulator.},
